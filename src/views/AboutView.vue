        This app was made by Daniel, Tilda, David and Christopher as a schoolproject. We decided to make a music app beacuse 
        it sounded like a splendid idea. The app pulls data from the Sveriges Radio API, which means that you'll have access to a large amount of information 
        about songs that have been played on the radio. This data is displayed in the app to help you test your music knowledge.
        As a starting point the app shows which 5 songs that were played the most from 
        three different time periods. More information will be added in the future!
